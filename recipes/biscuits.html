        Fluffy, tender buttermilk biscuits that require only 3 ingredients!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups self-rising flour</li>
      <li>1 stick frozen butter (1/2 cup) + more for brushing</li>
      <li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. (Read tips in notes before proceeding.)</li>
      <li>Add flour into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Grate the frozen butter into the flour.</li>
      <li>Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
      <li>Pour in the cold buttermilk and stir with a rubber spatula until a dough forms.</li>
      <li>Lightly flour a work surface and turn the dough out onto it.</li>
      <li>Flour your hands and gently knead the dough, adding more flour as needed. The dough should be slightly sticky.</li>
      <li>Fold the dough several times to create layers. Work quickly to keep the dough cold.</li>
      <li>Pat the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle.</li>
      <li>Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 4 biscuits. Regather and pat the remaining dough to cut more biscuits.</li>
      <li>Place biscuits on a baking sheet, sides touching.</li>
      <li>Bake for 12–14 minutes. (Optional: During the last 1–2 minutes, brush the tops lightly with melted butter and broil to brown the tops. Watch carefully.)</li>
      <li>As soon as biscuits come out of the oven, brush with melted butter. Once absorbed, brush again.</li>
    </ol>
