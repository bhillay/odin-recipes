    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 gallon buttermilk</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
  <li>1/2 white onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (I used Frank's)</li>
  <li>3 Tablespoons salt (optional, but adds great flavor)</li>
  <li>3 lbs fresh whole chicken, cut up</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seasoning Blend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 Tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon salt (can add more if desired)</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon cayenne (can add more if desired)</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon paprika</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 Tablespoon poultry seasoning</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon smoked salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tablespoon chili powder</li>
  <li>3 cups self-rising flour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Egg Mixture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>1/4 cup water</li>
  <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (can use more if desired)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, line with a brining or roasting bag, combine buttermilk, garlic, onion slices, 1/2 cup hot sauce, and salt (if using). Add chicken and tie the bag close so that the chicken is completely submerged in the brine. Refrigerate for up to 3 hours.</li>
  <li>Pour off the brine and shake off excess brine from chicken (you can rinse if desired). Combine the seasoning blend. Taste the seasoning blend to make sure it is salty and spicy enough for your taste. Adjust if needed. Place chicken on a baking tray and sprinkle on up to half of the seasoning mixture generously over the chicken on both sides. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix the rest of the spices into the flour gently (be careful not to inhale the spicy flour). Taste the flour and make sure it tastes seasoned. Add more seasoning to your liking. Flour should taste seasoned. Place the flour mixture into a large paper bag. Add chicken to the bag. Close the bag tightly and shake to coat the chicken.</li>
  <li>Remove the coated chicken from the bag and shake off the excess flour. Set aside. In a large dish, combine eggs, water, hot sauce, and garlic powder. Dip each piece of coated chicken into the egg mixture and shake off the excess egg mixture.</li>
  <li>Place chicken back into paper bag and shake to coat one last time. Remove chicken from bag and place on a plate.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet until a test piece of flour fries gently (about 350°F). Add chicken to skillet and cook until golden. Fry dark meats together and white meats together. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
  <li>When done, place chicken on a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with Cajun seasoning as soon as the chicken comes out of the oil, if desired. Serve hot and add hot sauce.</li>
